Software Quality Assurance (SQA) is a process that assures that all software engineering processes, methods, activities, 
and work items are monitored and comply with the defined standards. These defined standards could be one 
or a combination of anything like ISO 9000, CMMI model, ISO15504, etc.

Software quality assurance has some testing level
1.Unit testing.
2.Integration testing
3.System testing.

A software should be tested very early in the development phase so that we can save extra costing and extra working in the beginning of the development process.
